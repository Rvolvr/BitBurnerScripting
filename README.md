# BitBurnerScripting
This is my dive into JavaScript Learning. Hopefully this will be worth it. All scripts are specifically for the game [BitBurner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/ "Free Hacking sym game")
## What is the game?
This is a hacking symulator like most. It is free on Steam, as well as being here on [Github](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner). It is designed to be a way to break into useful scripting. The basics of JavaScript can be learned through Grasshopper on Android Play Store.
