# BitBurnerScripting
This is my dive into JavaScript Learning. Hopefully this will be worth it. All scripts are specifically for the game [BitBurner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/ "Free Hacking sym game")
## What is the game?
This is a hacking symulator like most. It is free on Steam, as well as being here on [Github](https://github.com/danielyxie/bitburner). It is designed to be a way to break into useful scripting. The basics of JavaScript can be learned through Grasshopper on Android Play Store. 
## JavaScipt
Literal JS files can be run on this game. Here is the script they teach in the tutorial.
``` JavaScript
/** @param {NS} ns */
export async function main(ns) {
		while(true) {
			await ns.hack('n00dles');
		}
}
```
